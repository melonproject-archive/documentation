Hub & Spoke
~~~~~~~~~~~

[[general]]
General
~~~~~~~

The Hub and Spoke contracts make up the core contract framework of the
Melon fund. Hub and Spoke is an architecture design to help reason about
all the moving parts of fund as constructed by an interconnected system
of linked smart contracts. The Hub will contain all relevant information
for all Spokes registered with the Hub. Each Spoke will independently
contain all relevant information about the Hub. Individual Spokes will
have programmatic access to information in specific other Spokes.

In general, there is one Hub contract and separate, distinct Spoke
contracts for each fund. (CHECK: Implementation for shared components as
spoke) The Hub forms the core of the individual Melon fund with each
Spoke contributing specific services to the fund. The Hub contract
stores the manager’s address and the fund name permanently in state, and
also contains the functionality to permanently and irreversibly shut the
Melon fund down.

Description
+++++++++++

The Hub maintains the specific Spoke components of the fund in terms of
their routing and their permissioning. Permissioning is of utmost
importance as it ensures only design-intended access to specific
components of the Melon fund smart contract system. The permissioning
has a very low-level granularity, exclusively permitting only specific
Spokes to invoke specific functions on specific target Spokes. This
surgical permissioning system ensures that sensitive function execution
can occur as intended and not by external actors.

[[overview]]
Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Manager (Investment Manager) is the central actor in the Melon Fund.
The Investment Manager is the creator of the Melon Fund and as such, the
`owner` of the Melon Fund smart contract. In this capacity, the
Investment Manager designs the initial set up of the Melon Fund,
including:

* Compliance rules regarding Investor participation
* Risk Engineering rules regarding Investments guidelines
* Management and Performance fees
* Exchanges to be used
* Asset Tokens eligible for Subscription and Redemption
* Fund name

Once the Melon Fund is set up, it will be open for investment from
Investors. When Investors transfer investment capital to the Melon Fund,
the Investment Manager has full discretionary investment allocation
authority over the assets, although Investors retain ultimate control
over their respective shares in the Melon Fund. The discretionary
investment allocation authority is, however, constrained by those Risk
Engineering rules put in place by the Investment Manager during fund set
up.

The critical point about a Melon Fund is that Investors retain control
of their investment in the fund, while delegating asset management
activity to the Investment Manager, who has the fine-grained trade and
asset management authority, but no ability to remove asset tokens from
the segregated safety of the Melon Fund’s smart contact custody.

The Investment Manager address can only be the Investment Manager for a
single Melon Fund per protocol Version, i.e. one address cannot manage
multiple Melon Funds on a Version.

[[fund-interaction]]
Fund Interaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Investment Manager in the capacity of `owner` of the Melon Fund
smart contract has the ability to interact with the following smart
contract functions:

* `enableInvestment()`
* `disableInvestment)()`
* `shutDown()` - Fund shutdown
* `callOnExchange()` - Make-, Take-, and Cancel Order

Please refer to the Fund components documentation for further details on
these functions.

'''''

[[investors]]
Investors
~~~~~~~~~

A Melon Fund is setup to serve Investors. That is, an Investment Manager
creates a Melon Fund in order to provide the service of managing capital
on behalf of participating Investors.

Investors are individuals or institutions participating in the
performance of Melon Funds by sending cryptographic Asset tokens to the
specific Melon Fund via the fund’s `requestInvestment()` function.

In the context of the platform, the Investor is the Ethereum address
from which the `requestInvestment()` was called and tokens sent (i.e.
`msg.sender`).

[[investor-address]]
Investor Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The individual Investor must retain the responsibility of secure custody
of the Investor address’s private key. The private key is required to
sign valid Ethereum transactions which are ultimately responsible for
calling specific functions and sending token amounts, covering the
activities of investing, redeeming and redeeming by slice.

WARNING: Loss or poor security of the Investor address’s private key
will result in the irreversible and permanent loss of all crypto asset
tokens associated with that address.

[[ethereum-addresses-and-keys]]
Ethereum Addresses and Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An Ethereum address takes the hexidecimal format of 20 bytes prefixed by
``0x''. Ethereum addresses are all lowercase, but may be mixed case if a
checksum is implemented. The private key is 256 random bits.

Example Ethereum Address: +
`0xdd4A3d9D44A670a80bAbbd60FD300a4C8C38561f`

Example Ethereum Private Key:

[[public-functions-2]]
Public Functions
++++++++++++++++

`function() public payable`

This public function is the contract’s fallback function enabling the
contract to receive ETH sent directly to the contract for the
`REQUEST_INCENTIVE`.

`function enableInvestment(address[] _assets) public auth`

This function requires that the caller is the `owner` or the manager or
the current contract. The function iterates over an array of provided
asset token addresses, ensuring each is registered with the Melon fund’s
PriceFeed, and ensures that registered asset token addresses are set to
`true` in the `investAllowed` mapping. Finally the function emits the
`EnableInvestment()` event, logging the `_assets`.  

`function disableInvestment(address[] _assets) public auth`

This function requires that the caller is the `owner` or the manager or
the current contract. The function iterates over an array of provided
asset token addresses and ensures that asset token addresses are set to
`false` in the `investAllowed` mapping. Finally the function emits the
`DisableInvestment()` event, logging the `_assets`.  

`function requestInvestment(uint requestedShares, uint investmentAmount, address investmentAsset) external notShutDown payable amguPayable(true) onlyInitialized`

This function ensures that the fund is not shutdown and that
subscription is permitted in the provided `ìnvestmentAsset`. The
function then creates and populates a `Request` struct (see details
above) from the function parameters provided and adds this to the
`requests` mapping corresponding to the `msg.sender`. Finally, this
function emits the `InvestmentRequest` event. Execution of this
functions requires payment of AMGU ETH to the Melon Engine to provide
the investment request execution incentive. This function implements the
`notShutDown`, `payable`, `amguPayable` and `onlyInitialized` modifiers.
 

`function cancelRequest() external payable amguPayable(0)`

This function removes the request from the `requests` mapping for the
request corresponding to the `msg.sender` address. The function requires
that a request exists and that at least one of the conditions to cancel
an investment request are met: invalid investment asset price, expired
request or fund is shut down. Investment asset tokens are transferred
back to the investor address. Finally, the function emits the
`CancelRequest` event, logging `msg.sender`. The function is `payable`
and also implements the `amguPayable` modifier, requiring amgu payment.
Here, the `deductFromRefund` parameter is set to `0`.  

`function executeRequestFor(address requestOwner) public notShutDown amguPayable(0) payable`

This function: ensures that the fund is not shutDown, ensures that
`requestOwner` has a valid subscription request, ensures that the
subscription asset has a valid price, triggers a management fee
calculation and reward, gets the current share cost in terms of the
subscription asset, ensures that the total share cost <= subscription
amount, transfers the subscription assets to the fund vault, calculates
change (remainder value) and returns any non-zero asset quantity to the
investor address, reset the `lockedAssetsForInvestor` mapping to ``0''
for the investor address, transfers the REQUEST_INCENTIVE to
`msg.sender`, creates the new shares and allocates them to the investor
address, adds the subscription asset token to the Melon fund’s list of
owned assets, emits the RequestExecution() event logging `requstOwner`,
`msg.sender`, `investmentAsset`, `investmentAmount` and
`requestedShares`. Finally, the function removes the `Request` from the
`requests` mapping for the `requestOwner` address. The function is
`payable` and also implements the `amguPayable` modifier, requiring amgu
payment. Here, the `deductFromRefund` parameter is set to `0`.  

`function getOwedPerformanceFees(uint shareQuantity) view returns (uint remainingShareQuantity)`

This view function calculates and returns the quantity of shares owed
for payment of accrued performance fees given the provided quantity of
shares being redeemed.  

`function redeem() public`

This function determines the quantity of shares owned by `msg.sender`
and calls `redeemQuantity()`. A share-commensurate quantity of all token
assets in the fund are transferred to `msg.sender`, i.e. the investor.
This function redeems _all_ shares owned by `msg.sender`.  

`function redeemQuantity(uint shareQuantity) public`

This function allows the investor to redeem a specified quantity of
shares held by the `msg.sender`, i.e. the investor.  

`function redeemWithConstraints(uint shareQuantity, address[] requestedAssets) public`

This function: ensures that the requested redemption share quantity is
less than or equal to the share quantity owned by the investor
(`msg.sender`), ensures that management fee shares have been calculated
and allocated immediately prior to redemption, ensures that accrued
performance fee shares have been calculated, allocated to the manager,
removed from the investor’s balance and added to total share supply
immediately prior to redemption, maintains parity between
`requestedAssets[]` array parameter and the `redeemedAssets[]` internal
array, ensuring that individual asset tokens are only redeemed once,
calculates the proportionate quantity of each token asset owned by the
investor (`msg.sender`) based on share quantity, destroys the investor’s
shares and reduces the fund’s total share supply by the same amount,
safely transfers all token assets in the correct quantities to the
`msg.sender` (investor) address using the ERC20 `transfer()` function,
and finally, the function emits the `SuccessfulRedemption()` event along
with the quantity of successfully redeemed shares.  

`function hasRequest(address _who) view returns (bool)`

This view function returns a boolean indicating whether the provided
address has a corresponding active request with a positive quantity of
requested shares in the `requests` mapping.  

`function hasValidRequest(address _who) public view returns (bool)`

This public view function returns a boolean indicating the `_who`
address parameter has a valid request, meaning that either this is the
address’s first subscription or the INVEST_DELAY is respected, the
subscription amount is greater than ``0'' and the requested share
quantity is greater than ``0''.  

`function hasExpiredRequest(address _who) view returns (bool)`

This view function returns a boolean indicating that the address
provided has a `requests` entry which is currently older than
`REQUEST_LIFESPAN`.

Description
+++++++++++

In fund management, shares assign proportionate ownership of the
collective underlying assets held in the fund. Each share in a fund has
equal claim to the fund’s assets. Shareholders then have a claim to the
underlying fund assets in proportion to the quantity of shares under
their control, i.e. ownership.

In a Melon fund, fund shares are represented as ERC20 tokens. Each token
has equal and proportionate claim to the underlying assets. The share
tokens are fungible but are not transferrable [CHECK if this will remain
so.] between owners.

As subscribed capital enters the fund, the Shares contract will create a
proportionate quantity of share tokens based on the current market
prices of the fund’s underlying assets and the market price of the
subscribed capital and assign allocate these newly created share tokens
to the subscribing address.

When share tokens are redeemed. A proportionate quantity of the fund’s
underlying asset tokens are transferred to the redeeming address and the
redeeming address’s redeemed share tokens are destroyed (i.e. set to 0)
and the fund’s total share quantity is reduced by that same quantity.

also implements the `amguPayable` modifier, requiring amgu payment.
Here, the `deductFromRefund` parameter is set to `0`.  

`function updateOwnedAssets() public`

This function maintains the `ownedAssets` array by removing or adding
asset addresses as the fund holdings composition changes.  

`function addAssetToOwnedAssets(address _asset) public auth`

This function requires that the caller is the `owner` or the trading
component contract or the participation component contract or current

`isInOwedAssets` mapping by adding asset addresses as the fund holdings
composition changes.  

`function removeFromOwnedAssets(address _asset) public auth`

This function requires that the caller is the `owner` or the trading
component contract or the current contract. The function maintains the
`ownedAssets` array and the `isInOwedAssets` mapping by removing asset
addresses as the fund holdings composition changes.

Fees
~~~~

[[general-3]]
General
~~~~~~~

Fees are charges levied against a Melon fund’s assets for:

* management services rendered, in the form of Management Fees
* fund performance achieved, in the form of Performance Fees.

Legacy investment funds are typically run as legal vehicle; a business
with income and expenses. As a traditional fund incurs expenses (not
only those listed above, but others like administration-, custody-,
directors-, audit fess), traditional funds must liquidate assets to cash
or pay the expenses out of cash held by the fund. This necessarily
reduces the assets of the fund and incurs further trading costs.

Melon funds employ a novel and elegant solution: Instead of using cash,
or liquidating positions to pay fees, the Melon fund smart contract
itself calculates and creates new shares (or share fractions),
allocating them to the investment manager’s own account holdings within
the fund as payment.

At that point, the investment manager can continue holding an increased
number of shares in their own fund, or redeem the shares to pay their
own operating costs, expand their research activities or whatever else
they deem appropriate. The Melon Fund smart contract autonomously and
verifiably maintains the shareholder accounting impact in a truly
reliable and transparent manner.

Paying fees in this manner has a few interesting side-effects: Assets do
not leave the fund, as would a cash payment. There are no unnecessary
trading or cash management transactions. Investors and managers have
access to real-time fee accrual metrics. Finally, the incentives to the
manager are reinforced beyond a cash performance fee by being paid in
the currency that is their own product.

The Management Fee and Performance Fee are each represented by an
individual contract. The business logic and functionality of each fee is
defined within the respective contract. The contract will interact with
the various components of the fund to calculate and return the quantity
of shares to create. This quantity is then added to the Manager address
balance and to the total supply balance.

The Fee Manager component manages the individual fee contracts which
have been configured for the Melon fund at set up. The core of the Fee
Manager is an array of Fee contract instances. Functions exist to prime
this array at fund setup with the selected and configured fee contracts,
as well as basic query functionality to aid the user interface in
calculating and representing the share NAV.

Fees are calculated and allocated when fund actions such as subscribe,
redeem or claim fees are executed by a participant. Calling
`rewardAllFees()` will iterate over the array of registered fees in the
fee manager, calling each fee’s calculation logic. This returns the
quantity of shares to create and allocate to the manager.

It is important to note that fee calculations take place before the
fund’s share quantity is impacted by subscriptions or redemptions. To
this end, when a subscription or redemption action is initiated by an
investor, the execution order first calculates fee amounts and creates
the corresponding share quantity, as the elapsed time and share quantity
at the start is known. Essentially, the Melon fund calculates and
records a reconciled state immediately and in the same transaction where
share quantity changes due subscription/redemption.

[[management-fees]]
Management Fees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Management Fees are earned with the passage of time, irrespective of
performance. The order of fee calculations is important. The Management
Fee share quantity calculation is a prerequisite to the Performance Fee
calculation, as fund performance must be reduced by the Management Fee
expense to fairly ascertain net performance.

The Management Fee calculation business logic is fully encapsulated by
the Management Fee contract. This logic can be represented as follows.

First, the time-weighted, pre-dilution share quantity is calculated:  

     

then, this figure is scaled such that investors retain their original
share holdings quantity, but newly created shares represent the
commensurate fee percentage amount:  

     

where,

      = pre-dilution quantity of shares

      = current shares outstanding

      = number of seconds elapsed since previous conversion event

      = number of seconds in a year ( = 60 _ 60 _ 24 * 365 )

      = Management Fee rate

      = number shares to create to compensate Management Fees earned
during the conversion period  

[[performance-fees]]
Performance Fees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performance Fees accrue over time with performance, but can only be
harvested after regular, pre-determined points in time. This period is
referred to as the Measurement Period and is decided by the fund manager
and configured at fund set up.

Performance is assessed at the end of the Measurement Period by
comparing the fund’s current share price net of Management Fees to the
fund’s current high-water mark (HWM).

The HWM represents the highest share valuation which the Melon fund has
historically achieved __at a Measurement Period ending time__. More
clearly, it is not a fund all-time-high, but rather the maximum share
valuation of all Measurement Period-end snapshot valuations.

If the difference to the HWM is positive, performance has been achieved
and a Performance Fee is due to the fund manager. This calculation is
straightforward and is the aforementioned difference multiplied by the
Performance Fee rate. The Performance Fee is _not_ an annualized fee
rate.

The calculation of the Performance Fee requires that, at that moment, no
Management Fees are due. This will be true as the code structure always
invokes the Management Fee calculation and allocation immediately
preceding, and in the same transaction, the Performance Fee calculation.

The Performance Fee calculation business logic is fully encapsulated by
the Performance Fee contract. This logic can be represented as follows.
 

     HWM_\{MP-1}\HWM_\{MP-1},&S_\{n}\end\{cases}“/>

 

     HWM_\{MP-1}\0,&GAV_\{s}\end\{cases}“/>

 

     

 

     

where,

      = high-water mark for the Measurement Period

      = current share price net of Management Fee

      = current fund Gross Asset Value

      = current fund GAV per share

      = performance for the Measurement Period

      = pre-dilution quantity of shares

      = current shares outstanding

      = Performance Fee rate

     = number shares to create to compensate Performance Fees earned
during the conversion period  

While Performance Fees are only crystalized at the end of each
measurement period, there must be a mechanism whereby redeeming
investors compensate for _their_ current share of accrued performance
fees prior to redemption.

In the case where an investor redeems prior to the current Measurement
Period’s end and where the current share price exceeds the fund HWM, a
Performance Fee is due. The Redemption business logic calculates the
accrued Performance Fee for the entire fund at the time of redemption
and weights this by the redemption share quantity’s proportion to the
fund’s total share quantity. The resulting percentage is the proportion
of the redemption share quantity due as the redeeming investor’s
Performance Fee payment. This quantity is deducted from the redeeming
share quantity and credited to the manager’s share account balance. The
remaining redeeming share quantity is destroyed as the proportionate
individual token assets are transferred out of the fund and the fund’s
total share quantity and the investor’s share quantity is reduced by
this net redeeming share quantity.

*Note on Fee Share Allocation*

The intended behavior is for the Manager to immediately redeem fee
shares as they are created. This will ensure a fair and precise share
allocation. The implemented code that represents the fee calculations
above contain smart contract optimizations for state variable storage.
By not immediately redeeming fee shares, a negligible deviation to the
manager fee payout will arise due to this optimization.

[[trading]]
Trading
~~~~~~~

The Melon Protocol integrates with decentralized exchanges to facilitate
the trading of Assets, one of the essential functionalities of a Melon
Fund. This means that a Melon Fund must accommodate multiple different
decentralized exchanges smart contracts if the fund is to draw from a
wider pool of liquidity.

[[trading.sol]]

[[description-9]]
Description
+++++++++++

The Trading contract is created by the tradingFactory, which holds a
queryable array of all created Trading contracts and emits the
`instanceCreated` event along with the trading contract’s address.

The trading contract:

-manages the set up of the interface infrastructure to the various
selected exchanges.

-manages open make orders that the fund has submitted to the various
registered exchanges.

-houses the common function for calling specific exchange functions
through each exchange’s respective exchange adapters. Note that each
exchange will have their own unique interface and required parameters,
which the adapters accommodate.

-provides a public function to transfer an array of token assets to the
fund’s vault.

-provides view functions to get order information regarding specific
assets on specific exchanges as well as specific order detail.

The contract has a fallback function to retrieve ETH.

Inherits from Spoke, DSMath, TradingInterface, TokenUser (link)

On Construction

The contract requires the hub address, an array of exchange addresses,
an array of exchange adapter addresses, an array of booleans indicating
if an exchange takes custody of tokens for make orders and the address
of the Registry contract. The contract becomes a spoke to the hub. The
constructor of the trading contract requires that the length of the
exchange array matches the length of exchange adapter array and the
length of the exchange array matches the length of boolean custody
status array. Finally, the constructor builds the public variable
`exchanges[]` array of `Exchange` structs.  

[[structs-9]]

`Exchange`

Member Variables

`address exchange` - The address of the decentralized exchange smart
contact.

`address exchangeAddress` - The address of the decentralized exchange
smart contact.

`bytes32 orderId` - A unique identifier for a specific order on the

token owned and provided in exchange.

`uint timestamp` - The timestamp of the block in which the submitted
order transaction was mined.

`uint fillTakerQuantity` - An integer representing the quantity of the
maker asset token traded in the make order. This value is not
necessarily the same as the `makerQuantity` because taker participants
can choose to only partially execute the order, i.e. take a lower
quantity of the `makerAsset` token than specified by the order’s
`makerQuantity`.  

`OpenMakeOrder`

Member Variables

`uint id` - An integer originating from the exchange which uniquely
identifies the order within the exchange.

`uint expiresAt` - An integer representing the time when the order
expires. The timestamp is represented by the Ethereum blockchain as a
UNIX Epoch. After order expiration, the order will no longer [exist/be
active] on the exchange and custody, if the exchange held custody,
returns from the exchange contract to the fund contract.

`function isOrderExpired(address exchange, address asset) public view returns (bool)`

This public view function returns a boolean indicating whether an order
for the asset token and exchange provided is currently expired.  

`function addExchange(address _exchange, address _adapter, bool _takesCustody) internal`

This is an internal function which is called for each exchange address
passed to the constructor, adding the full exchange struct to the
exchanges array state variable. The function ensures that an exchange
has not previously been registered.  

`function callOnExchange(     uint exchangeIndex,     string methodSignature,     address[6] orderAddresses,     uint[8] orderValues,     bytes32 identifier,     bytes makerAssetData,     bytes takerAssetData,     bytes signature ) public onlyInitialized`

This is the fund’s general interface to each registered exchange for
trading asset tokens. The client will call this function for specific
exchange/trading interactions. This function first calls the
policyManager to ensure that function-specific policies are pre- or
post-executed to ensure that the exchange trade adheres to the policies
configured for the fund. This function implements the `onlyInitialized`
modifier. Finally, the function emits the `ExchangeMethodCall()` event,
logging the specified parameters.  

`function addOpenMakeOrder(     address ofExchange,     address sellAsset,     address buyAsset,     uint orderId,     uint expirationTime ) public delegateInternal`

This public function can only be called from within the current
contract. The function ensures that the sell asset token does not
already have a current open sell order and that there are one or more
orders in the `orders` array. If the `expirationTime` is set to ``0'',
the order’s expiration time is set to `ORDER_LIFESPAN`. The expiration
time is required to be greater that the current `block.timestamp` and
less than or equal to the sum of the `ORDER_LIFESPAN` and
`block.timestamp`. The function then sets the `isInOpenMakeOrder`
mapping for the sell asset token address to `true`, and sets the details
of the address’s `openMakeOrder` struct on the contracts
`exchangesToOpenMakeOrders` mapping.  

`function removeOpenMakeOrder(     address exchange,     address sellAsset ) public delegateInternal`

This public function can only be called from within the current
contract. The function removes the provided sell asset token address
entry for the provided exchange address.  

`function orderUpdateHook(     address ofExchange,     bytes32 orderId,     UpdateType updateType,     address[2] orderAddresses,     uint[3] orderValues ) public delegateInternal`

This public function can only be called from within the current
contract. The function used the input parameters and the current
execution block’s timestamp to push make- or take orders to the `orders`
array. [Why only make or take orders??]  

`function updateAndGetQuantityBeingTraded(address _asset) public returns (uint)`

This public function returns the sum of the quantity of the provided
asset token address held by the current contract and the quantity of the
provided asset token held across all registered exchanges in the fund’s
make orders. The sum returned excluded quantities in make orders where
the exchange does not take custody of the tokens.  

`function updateAndGetQuantityHeldInExchange(address ofAsset) public returns (uint)`

This public function sums and returns all quantities of the provided
asset token address in make orders across all registered exchanges,
excluding, however, quantities in make orders where the exchange does
not take custody of the tokens, but uses the ERC-20 ``approve''
functionality. The rationale is that token quantities in ``approve''
status are not actually held by the exchange. The function also
maintains the `exchangesToOpenMakeOrders` and `isInOpenMakeOrder`
mappings.  

`function returnAssetToVault(address _token) public`

This public function transfers all token quantities of the provided
array of token asset addresses from the current current contract’s
custody back to the fund’s vault.  

`function addZeroExOrderData(bytes32 orderId, LibOrder.Order zeroExOrderData) delegateInternal`

This function adds the data provided by the parameters to the
orderIdToZeroExOrder mapping state variable.  

`function returnBatchToVault(address[] _tokens) public`

This public function returns all asset tokens represented by the
`_tokens` address array parameter and returns the asset tokens to the
Melon fund’s vault.  

`function getExchangeInfo() public view returns (address[], address[], bool[])`

This public view function returns two address arrays and one boolean
array with all corresponding registered exchange contract addresses,
adapter contract addresses and the `takesCustoday` indicators.  

`function getOpenOrderInfo(address ofExchange, address ofAsset) public view returns (uint, uint, uint)`

This public view function takes the exchange contract address and an
asset token contract address and returns three integers: the order
identifier, the order expiration time and the order index.  

`function getOrderDetails(uint orderIndex) public view returns (address, address, uint, uint)`

This public view function takes the order index as a parameter and
returns the maker asset token contract address, the taker asset token
contract address, the maker asset token quantity and the taker asset
token quantity.  

`function getZeroExOrderDetails(bytes32 orderId) public view returns (LibOrder.Order)`

This public view function takes the order identifier as a parameter and
returns the corresponding populated `Order` struct.  

[[exchange-adapters]]
Exchange Adapters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exchange Adapters are smart contracts which communicate directly and
on-chain with the intended DEX smart contract. They serve as a
translation bridge between the Melon Fund and the DEX.

Currently, the Melon Protocol has adapters to integrate the following
DEXs:

* Oasis DEX
* 0x (enabling interaction on the orderbooks of all 0x relayers)
* Kyber Network
* Ethfinex

Each exchange is tied to a specific adapter by the canonical registrar.
A fund can be setup to use multiple exchanges, provided they are
registered by the registrar.

[[adapter-function-details]]
Adapter Function Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Fund.sol` smart contract in the Melon Protocol (the blockchain fund
instance) commonly uses the following functions in the Exchange Adapter
to interact with the intended DEX for trading purposes:

* `makeOrder()` Creates a new order in the DEX’s order book. The order
may not be immediately executed. Note that this function will not be
implemented for the 0x adapter until 0x Version 2 is released.
* `takeOrder()` Represents implicit agreement with a standing make order
on the DEX’s order book. The order will be immediately executed.
* `cancelOrder()` Retracts a standing make order from the DEX’s order
book. The cancelation will be immediately executed.

A single event is emitted by the Exchange Adapter:

* `OrderUpdated()` Event to inform other layers (e.g. web page) that the
order has been updated in some way.

The following functions are public view functions:

* `getLastOrderId()` - Constant view function which returns the last
order Id on a specific exchange.
* `getOrder()` - Constant view function which returns the order’s sell
asset address, buy asset address, sell asset quantity and buy asset
quantity on a given exchange for a given order Id.

Note that fund is not limited to these functions and can call arbitrary
functions on the exchange adapters using delegate calls, provided the
function signature is whitelisted by the canonical registrar.

`function register(bytes4 sig, address _policy) public auth`

This function requires that the caller is the `owner` or the current
contract. This public function first ascertains whether the Policy being
registered with the PolicyManager is to be executed as a pre- or post
condition and then pushes the Policy with the corresponding signature
hash on to the respective pre or post Policy array within the policies
mapping. Once a Policy is registered, the condition defined within the
Policy will be the standard against which the policy-registered
function’s consequential state changes will be tested. If the state
changes pass the policy test, the function will continue execution
unhindered and the state changes, e.g. a trade and the respective
changes to token allocation) will become final as part of a transaction
in a mined block. If the state changes do not pass the policy test, the
transaction will revert and no state change will be affected.

 

`function getPoliciesBySig(bytes4 sig) public view returns (address[], address[])`

This view function returns two address arrays (pre and post,

registered policies for a specific function call.  

`function preValidate(bytes4 sig, address[5] addresses, uint[3] values, bytes32 identifier) view public`

This view function calls the `validate()` function, explicitly passing
the `pre` array from the `policies` mapping state variable filtered for
Policies registered for the provided function signature hash `sig`.  

`function postValidate(bytes4 sig, address[5] addresses, uint[3] values, bytes32 identifier) view public`

This view function calls the `validate()` function, explicitly passing
the `post` array from the `policies` mapping state variable filtered for
Policies registered for the provided function signature hash `sig`.  

`function validate(Policy[] storage aux, bytes4 sig, address[5] addresses, uint[3] values, bytes32 identifier) view internal`

This internal view function receives a function-specific filtered array
of Policy contract addresses and iterates over the array, calling each
Policy’s implemented `rule()` function. If the call to a Policy’s
`rule()` evaluates to `true`, execution and any state transition
proceeds. If the call to a Policy’s `rule()` evaluates to `false`, all
execution and preliminary state transitions are reverted.  

[[policies]]
Policies
~~~~~~~~

Polices are individual smart contracts which define rule or set of rules
to be compared to the state of the Melon fund. Policies simply assess
the current state of the Melon fund and resolve to a boolean decision,
whether the action may be executed or not, returning `true` for allowed
actions and `false` for disallowed actions. The Melon fund-specific
Policies are deployed with parameterized values which the defined Policy
logic uses to assess the permissibility of the action.

[[pre--and-post-conditionality]]
Pre- and Post-Conditionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Policies are intended to be rules; they are intended to permit or
prevent specific behavior or action depending on the _state_ as compared
to specified criteria.

Some Policies, due to the nature of the data required, can be
immediately resolved based on the _current_ state. The resolution of the
Policy result is trivial because all data needed is at hand and must nod
be derived or calculated. Such Policies can be defined as
``pre-condition'' Policies.

Other Policies may need to assess the consequence of the behavior or
action before the logic can assess its permissibility relative to the
defined rule. To do this, the result of the action must be derived or
calculated, essentially asking, ``What _will_ the state be if this
action is executed?'' Such Policies can be defined as ``post-condition''
Policies.

On the blockchain and in smart contracts, we can use a fortunate
side-effect of the process of mining and block finalization to help
determine the validity of post-condition Policies. With post-condition
Policies, the action or behavior is executed with the smart contract
logic and the changed (but not yet finalized or mined) state is assessed
against the logic and defined parameters of the post-condition Policy.
In the case where this new state complies with the logic and criteria of
the Policy, the action is allowed, meaning the smart contract execution
is allowed to run to completion, the block is eventually mined and this
new compliant state is finalized in that mined block. In the case where
the new state does not comply with the logic and criteria of the Policy,
the action is disallowed and the revert() function is called, stopping
execution and discarding (or rolling back) all state changes. In calling
the revert() function, gas is consumed to arrive at the reference state,
but any unused gas is returned to the caller as the reference state is
discarded.

`function rule(bytes4 sig, address[5] addresses, uint[3] values, bytes32 identifier) external view returns (bool)`

This view function is called by the PolicyManager to ensure that
specific registered function calls are validated by their respective
registered Policy validation logic. The function returns `true` when
conditions defined in the Policy are met and execution continues to
successful completion. If conditions defined in the Policy are no met,
the function returns `false`, all execution up to that point is reverted
and execution cannot complete, returning all remaining gas.

The `rule()` function takes a function signature hash `sig`, an array of
address `addresses`, an array of uint `values` and an `identifier` are
passed as parameters. For the arrays, the order of the address or value
in the array is semantically significant. The individual array
positions, [n], are defined as follows:

`address[5] addresses`:

[0] order maker - the address initiating or offering the trade [1] order
taker - the address filling or partially filling the offered trade [2]
maker asset - the token address of the asset token intended by the order
maker to exchange for another token asset, i.e. the taker asset [3]
taker asset - the token address of the asset token to be received by the
offer maker in exchange for the maker asset [4] exchange address -
address of the exchange contract on which the order is to be placed

`uint[3] values`:

[0] maker token quantity - the maximum quantity of the maker asset token
to be given by the order maker in exchange for the specified taker asset
token [1] taker token quantity - the maximum quantity of the taker asset
token to be received by the order maker in exchange for the specified
maker asset token [2] Fill amount - the quantity of the taker token
exchanged in the transaction. Must be less than or equal to the taker
token quantity [1]

Finally, `identifier` and `sig` parameters are described below:

`bytes32 identifier` - order id for exchanges utilizing a unique,
exchange-specific order identifier

`bytes4 sig` - the keccak256 hash of the plain text function signature
of the function which triggers the specific policy validation.  

`function position() external view returns (Applied)`

This view function returns the enum `Applied` which is defined for each
specific Policy contract. The `Applied` enum indicates whether the
Policy logic is applied prior to, or after the corresponding function’s
execution. This function is called when the Policy contract is
registered with the PolicyManager contract.

[[compliance]]
Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~

[[general-4]]
General
~~~~~~~

The contracts below define the business logic for the screening of
investor addresses allowed to- or prevented from subscribing to a Melon
fund.

In the Melon Protocol, the term ``Compliance'' revolves around the
specifics of investing as an Investor _into_ Melon Fund. This is often
referred to as a ``Subscription''. Details around which addresses,
amounts and when Investors may subscribe to the Melon Fund are
configured in-, and managed by the Compliance module. To clarify, in the
traditional investment management industry, ``compliance'' is also used
to refer to trading of underlying fund assets, as in a whether a certain
asset or trade is compliant with portfolio guidelines, laws and
regulations. This type of intra-portfolio asset level compliance is
handled by the Risk Engineering module in the Melon Protocol.

The main use case for the Melon Fund Compliance module is the ability to
create and maintain a whitelist for specific addresses. That is, the
Investment Manager can explicitly define specific addresses which will
then have the ability to subscribe to the Melon Fund.

Note that any listing of an address on the Compliance module whitelist
only impacts the Investor’s _ability_ to subscribe to the Melon Fund. An
existing investment from a specific address will remain invested
irrespective of any change in that address’s whitelist status. The
current implementation does not affect an address status after the fact.
Whitelist removal does not affect an invested address’s current invested
status or ability to redeem, but will prevent future subscriptions. The
whitelist can be seen as a positive filter, creating a known universe of
allowed investor addresses. Investor addresses can be added to- or
removed from the whitelist, individually or in batch by the fund manager
(`owner`).

[[future-directions]]
Future Directions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Melon Fund Compliance module potentially has great significance for
regulators and regulatory frameworks. Possible use cases are: Regulators
or KYC/AML providers may create and maintain their own whitelist of
Investor addresses in a Melon Compliance module that individual Melon
Funds could query; the ability for the Investment Manager to ``Hard
Close'' or ``Soft Close'' subscriptions; the ability to cap subscription
amounts.

Hard Close - A fund refuses all new investment subscriptions, usually
due to capacity limitations for a specific strategy.

Soft Close - A fund refuses investment subscriptions new Investors, but
accepts investment top-ups from existing Investors (addresses).

[[risk-engineering-policies]]
Risk Engineering Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[general-5]]
General
~~~~~~~

[[risk-management-vs-risk-engineering]]
Risk Management vs Risk Engineering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

_Risk_ is the effect of uncertainty on objectives; the risk is the
possibility that an event will occur and adversely affect the
achievement of an objective.

Risk is uncertainty with implicit consequences. In general, the investor
cares about two types of risk: 1) those for which she receives
compensation in return for bearing, and 2) those for which no
compensation is received. It is obvious that the latter must be
eliminated to the extent possible.

For example, the following shows risk dissected into systematic risk and
unsystematic risk:

image:./assets/types-of-risk.png[]

We can observe that unsystematic risk can be _completely_ eliminated
from the portfolio by sufficiently diversifying or simply having a
sufficient number of assets in the portfolio. Of course, these assets
must be reasonably uncorrelated with each other.

Critically, an investor is NOT compensated for bearing unsystematic
risk, and this would be detrimental to the portfolio’s return (and the
investor’s wealth) over time.

[[ex-post---management]]
Ex Post -> ``Management''
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Risks which have materialized should be managed to the extent possible.
Examples:

* A position in the portfolio experiences positive returns to the point
that the allocation breaches a concentration guideline. Managing this
concentration risk means liquidating a portion of the position to return
the position to a tolerable percentage of the portfolio. The proceeds
are then allocated to other existing or new positions at the discretion
of the investment manager.
* A position’s price volatility increases to the point that it becomes
too ``risky'' for the portfolio. This could be regarding the allocation
or in general. In the former case, the position would be reduced so that
the asset-weighted volatility of the portfolio returns to tolerable
levels

[[ex-ante---engineering]]
Ex Ante -> ``Engineering''
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are potential risks that we can explicitly prohibit with
blockchain tooling. This is where we want to shine.

Portfolio guidelines are rules which are laid out in a legal document
(Offering Memorandum or Prospectus) prior to fund inception. Here, the
parties agree on the types of instruments to be invested, strategy,
rules about concentration and other rule-based metrics.

All institutional fund managers use software to help them manage
portfolios. They will say, ``Our software will not allow a trade which
conflicts with the guidelines'', or they will have a process in place
which has a name like ``pre-trade clearance'' or ``hypothetical
trading''. These methods have served the industry to a satisfactory
level, but non-compliant trades do find their way into a portfolio.

Melon funds approach risk differently. Melon fund currently implement
_risk engineering_ i.e. anticipating a specific risk and handling it in
the code of the smart contract. Essentially, this is a proactive
posture, as opposed to a reactive posture.

_Risk engineering_ is the anticipation and identification of different
risks, and the action of preventing their occurrence through code. Rules
coded into smart contracts that are meant to ensure that something
*cannot not* happen in the structure of a Melon fund.

[[what-is-risk-management]]
What is risk management ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* the *forecasting and evaluation of financial risks* together with the
*identification of procedures to avoid or minimize their impact*
* *identification, evaluation and prioritization of risks* followed by
coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor
and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events.
* Risk management’s objective is to **assure uncertainty does not
deflect the endeavor from the business goals**.
* Strategies to manage threats, typically includes: *avoiding the
threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat,
transferring all or part of the threat to another party* and even
retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a
particular threat.
* Risk with greatest loss or impact and the greatest probability of
occurring are handled first, and risks with lower probability of
occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order.

In Melon, it’s different. We’re not doing risk management, rather are we
doing _risk engineering_ ie. anticipating the risk ahead of time, and
handling it in the code of the smart contract. Being proactive vs
reactive.

_risk engineering_ = the anticipation and identification of different
risks ahead of time, and the action of preventing their occurrence
through code. Rules coded into smart contracts that are meant to make
sure that something *will not* happen in the context of a Melon fund.

*What risks can we identify within the context of a Melon fund?*

* Malevolent behavior of fund manager (trying to embezzle funds through
orders on exchanges)
* Bad trading decisions from fund manager
* Deviation from initial strategy as laid out in the prospectus from
fund manager
* Fund manager doesn’t adhere to the level of risk that was communicated
to the investors (volatility risk, sharpe ratio)
* Redemption risk
* Liquidity risk

*What could on-chain risk engineering entail?*

* Prevent investors from fund embezzlement through exchanges.
* Ensure that the fund operates accordingly to approved fund
characteristics and other risk guidelines.
* Trading limits: Approve or reject trades based on: - is asset
authorized? - is the asset liquid enough? - is the post trade holdings
allocation acceptable? -Nominal (gross/net positions, concentration) -
is the price _reasonable_ (ie. best execution)? - is the volatility
implications of this trade acceptable according to portfolio guidelines?
* Price feed providing additional data on assets, useful to risk
management such as historical volatility, average annual rates of return
and average standard deviation. Is that conceivable?

*Which kind of off-chain risk engineering tooling can we provide?*

* Risk engineering should also encompass monitoring of portfolio’s risk
in light of market risk. Simple monitoring can be done off-chain at the
discretion of the fund manager. Monitoring of indicators such as
downside capture [1], drawdown [2], leverage etc.
* Possible to link up your fund with risk engineering trading bot such
as rebalancing bots (eg. rebalancing based on allocation or rebalancing
based on risk parity). Could be simple trading bots, not necessarily
enforced on-chain.
* Tools to monitor VaR: measures the dollar-loss expectation that can
occur with a 5% probability.
* Tools to monitor redemption risk (based on redemption requests,
redemption history and in light of current portfolio allocation)

[1]
(https://www.investopedia.com/university/hedge-fund/risks.asp[*Downside
Capture*]) In relation to hedge funds, and in particular those that
claim absolute return objectives, the measure of
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down-market-capture-ratio.asp[downside
capture] can indicate how correlated a fund is to a market when the
market declines. The lower the downside capture, the better the fund
preserves wealth during market downturns. This metric is figured by
calculating the cumulative return of the fund for each month that the
market/benchmark was down, and dividing it by the cumulative return of
the market/benchmark in the same time frame. Perfect correlation with
the market will equate to a 100% downside capture and typically is only
possible when comparing the benchmark to itself.

%5B**Drawdown**%5D(https://www.investopedia.com/university/hedge-fund/risks.asp)[2]
Another measure of a fund’s risk is maximum
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp[drawdown]. Maximum
drawdown measures the percentage drop in cumulative return from a
previously reached high. This metric is good for identifying funds that
preserve wealth by minimizing drawdowns throughout up/down cycles, and
gives an analyst a good indication of the possible losses that this fund
can experience at any given point in time. Months to recover, on the
other hand, gives a good indication of how quickly a fund can recuperate
losses. Take the case where a hedge fund has a maximum drawdown of 4%,
for example. If it took three months to reach that maximum drawdown, as
investors, we would want to know if the returns could be recovered in
three months or less. In some cases where the drawdown was sharp, it
should take longer to recover. The key is to understand the speed and
depth of a drawdown with the time it takes to recover these losses. Do
they make sense given the strategy?

[[rule-set-identification-and-specification]]
Rule set identification and specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section contains all the possible on-chain rules we have
identified. Only a few of them will be implemented in v1 (see
implemented policies).

[[rule-1-maximum-number-of-positions]]
Rule 1: Maximum number of positions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund may not exceed X positions. **Rationale**: (i)
Avoid over-diversification. (ii) Avoid excessive rebalancing
transactions in the event of a new subscription (or redemption).
**Implementation**: Before a trade is authorized, the system must get
the number of different assets held by the fund, and make sure that
adding 1 asset does not breach the X maximum number of positions.
**Parameters**: X as the maximum number of underlying positions.

[[rule-2-whitelisted-assets]]
Rule 2: Whitelisted assets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: The fund can only invest in explicitly permitted assets
(included in the whitelisted asset universe defined at fund setup).
**Rationale**: (i) Investors have a clear understanding of which assets
can ever be invested in by the fund. (ii) Restrict the investment
manager. Tighten scope of the investment universe. (iii) Fund can only
invest in a niche classification (eg. ESG, utility tokens, virtual
currencies, commodities only etc.) **Implementation**: Before a trade is
authorized, the system must check that the asset being bought is
included in the whitelisted asset universe of the fund. The asset
registrar may contain an additional field _categories_ that informs
about the nature/type of the asset. This _category_ field can then be
queried by the contract before authorizing trading of the asset. Other
relevant categories: type (utility, security etc.), sector, country (of
jurisdiction) etc. **Parameters**: Whitelisted assets list or list of
category (with specification of _AND_ or _OR_ relationship) **Side
note**: There could be a method to remove an asset from the whitelist.
Fund manager should not be able to add an asset to the whitelist.

[[rule-3-blacklisted-assets]]
Rule 3: Blacklisted assets
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: The fund is explicitly prohibited from investing in some
assets. **Rationale**: (i) Investors have a guarantee that the fund will
never invest in a type of asset. (ii) Restricts Investment manager (iii)
Regulatory compliance (iv) Investor preferences. **Implementation**:
Before a trade is authorized, the system must check that the asset being
bought is not included in the blacklisted assets list. The asset
registrar may contain an additional field _categories_ that informs
about the nature/type of the asset. This _category_ field can then be
queried by the contract before authorizing trading of the asset.
**Parameters**: Blacklisted assets list **Side note**: There could be a
method to add an asset from the backlist. Fund manager should not be
able to remove an asset from the blacklist.

[[rule-4-max-concentration]]
Rule 4: Max concentration (%)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A position (or positions in a single category) can not
actively exceed X% of the NAV. **Rationale**: (i) Avoid cluster risk.
(ii) Portfolio diversification (iii) Reduce unsystematic risk.
**Implementation**: Before a trade is authorized, the system must check
the current proportion of NAV that this asset (or category) represents
and computes the post trade proportion of NAV. If the post trade
proportion of NAV exceeds X%, the trade will not be authorized.
**Parameters**: X as the maximum % a position’s value can represent of
the NAV.

[[rule-5-early-redemption-penalty-this-may-be-contained-in-the-compliance-contract]]
Rule 5: Early redemption penalty (this may be contained in the compliance contract)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: An investor can be incurred a penalty if he redeems his
shares before the end of the specified period. **Rationale**: VC funds,
private equity funds. Longer time horizon funds. **Implementation**:
This is not part of the risk management contract per se, rather should
be implemented as a compliance/participation module. **Parameters**:
period (probably expressed in # of blocks before redemption is possible)
and penalty.

[[rule-6-best-price-execution]]
Rule 6: Best price execution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund manager is not allowed to deviate more than X%
away from the reference price provided by the price feed. **Rationale**:
(i) Prohibit predatory investment manager behavior. (ii) Wash trading
mitigation **Implementation**: Before a trade is authorized, the system
must check the price of the order against the reference price and ensure
the former does not deviate away more than X% from the reference price.
**Parameters**: x as % of allowed deviation.

[[rule-7-turnover-expressed-in-of-trades]]
Rule 7: Turnover (expressed in # of trades)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: Restrict the number of trades. The fund manager is
restricted from exceeding the maximum number of trades allowed.
**Rationale**: (i) Prevent predatory behavior from the investment
manager. (ii) Wash trading prevention. (iii) Keep transactions fees to
the minimum. **Implementation**: Before a trade is authorized, the
system must check if this additional trade does not exceed the maximum #
of trades allowed on the defined time period. **Parameters**: max number
of trades, time period.

Consider volume turnover in terms of portfolio base currency.

Note, top-ups (reductions) due to subscriptions (redemptions) should not
count as turnover. Only discretionary investment decisions

[[rule-8-turnover-expressed-in-volume-traded]]
Rule 8: Turnover (expressed in volume traded)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: Restrict the number of trades. The fund manager is
restricted from exceeding the maximum volume in trades allowed in a
given timeframe. **Rationale**: (i) Prevent predatory behavior from the
investment manager. (ii) Wash trading prevention. (iii) Keep
transactions fees to the minimum. **Implementation**: Before a trade is
authorized, the system must check if this additional trade does not
exceed the maximum volume of trades allowed on the defined time period.
**Parameters**: max number volume of trades (expressed in the currency
of denomination of the fund), time period.

Consider volume turnover in terms of portfolio base currency.

Note, top-ups (reductions) due to subscriptions (redemptions) should not
count as turnover. Only discretionary investment decisions

[[rule-9-market-cap-range]]
Rule 9: Market cap range
++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund can only invest in assets whose market cap is
contained in a certain range [x;y] (ie x < market cap < y).
**Rationale**: Strategy focus enforce **Implementation**: Before trade
is authorized, the system must check the market cap of the assets being
traded and verify that the market cap is compliant with the market cap
range defined at fund setup. The asset registrar may contain an
additional field _market cap_ for each asset. Open question: how to
measure Market Cap. Only influences the trade permission at time of
trade. That is, there is no consequence when an owned asset’s market cap
breaches the upper or lower specified bounds. **Parameters**: x as low
boundary of the range and y as high boundary of the range.

[[rule-10-volatility-threshold-for-a-specific-asset]]
Rule 10: Volatility threshold for a specific asset
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund can only invest (purchase) in an asset whose
volatility reference indicator is contained in a certain range [x;y] (ie
x < volatility < y). **Rationale**: Investors have an understanding of
the volatility level of individual assets that are allowed in the
portfolio at the time of inclusion. **Implementation**: Before a trade
is authorized, the system must check the volatility reference indicator
of the said asset and make sure it is included in the specified [x;y]
range. The volatility reference indicator could be standard deviation
but also downside deviation. Possible relevant indicators: standard
deviation, Sharpe ratio, Sortino indicator. **Parameters**: x as low
boundary of the acceptable volatility range and y as high boundary of
the acceptable volatility range.

Portfolio base currency cannot be considered for this rule.

[[rule-11-portfolio-volatility-threshold]]
Rule 11: Portfolio volatility threshold
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund is prevented from performing a trade if the
effect on the portfolio volatility is undesirable (ie if volatility post
trade exceeds X% level of volatility) **Rationale**: Investors have an
understanding of the volatility level of the portfolio maintained at the
time of trading. **Implementation**: Before a trade is authorized, the
system must check the post volatility of the total portfolio and make
sure it is included in the specified [x;y] range. **Parameters**: x as
low boundary of the acceptable portfolio volatility range and y as high
boundary of the acceptable portfolio volatility range. **Side note**:
This computation may be too expensive on Ethereum smart contract. We
might be able to use a simplified computation. But this rule is to be
envisioned in the Melon chain context.

Edge case: Could also allow trades which incrementally reduce (increase)
portfolio volatility. Basically, is the trade beneficial to the investor
and in the spirit of the guidelines.

[[rule-12-liquidity]]
Rule 12: Liquidity
++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund can only invest in assets whose liquidity is
contained in a certain range [x;y] (ie x < liquidity < y). +
**Rationale**: (i) enforce strategy focus **Implementation**: Before a
trade is authorized, the system must check the liquidity available for
that asset and make sure it is included in the specified [x;y] range.
The liquidity data is retrieved from the exchanges the fund is allowed
to trade on. Liquidity can be expressed as the % of your trade volume
over the 30-days ADV (average daily volume traded). **Parameters**: x as
low boundary and y as high boundary of range.

[[rule-13-correlation-of-adding-an-asset-to-portfolio]]
Rule 13: Correlation of adding an asset to portfolio
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund can invest in an asset if its correlation with
the current portfolio is contained between a range [x;y] **Rationale**:
(i) making sure that adding an asset helps optimizing the portfolio or
at least move it in the right direction. **Implementation**: Before a
trade is authorized, the system must compute the correlation of that
asset to the portfolio and make sure it is included in the specified
[x;y] range. **Parameters**: x as low boundary and y as high boundary of
the correlation range.

[[rule-14-time-horizon]]
Rule 14: Time horizon
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund manager needs to hold an asset for specific
average period of time. **Implementation**: We voluntarily decide not to
encode that rule in a smart contract as it can lead to dangerous
situations for the fund. Could be as a guideline for informational
purposes but won’t be enforced.

(not seen in practice, could be gamed by investor redemption and
subsequent re-investment; must be thoughtfully aligned with lockup.)

[[rule-15-full-investment]]
Rule 15: Full investment
++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Definition**: A fund manager can defined the full investment threshold
ie. the proportion of assets invested vs the proportion of cash held.
**Rationale**: The fund manager should not stay passive collecting
management fees just by holding too large proportion of cash (taking no
risk) risk. **Implementation**: We do not want to enforce that rule as
the fund manager should have the flexibility to put everything in safety
in case of imminent market crash or similar event. It could simply be an
informational rule that can be used in monitoring/reporting tool to
compare with actual investment levels of the fund. **Parameters**: X as
the percentage of NAV invested. Remove, unimportant; could cause
sub-optimal behavior - keep as indicator for reporting.

[[rule-16-generalizable-51040-rule.]]
Rule 16: Generalizable 5/10/40 rule.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a current UCITS rule. Positions may not exceed 10% of NAV, and
that assets which exceed 5% of NAV summed together may not exceed 40% as
a group.

[[rule-17-specific-assetcategory-max]]
Rule 17: Specific Asset/Category Max (%)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This rule assigns a maximum allocation as a percentage of NAV to a
specific token or category. This is slightly different from Rule 4 which
is an unspecified, blanket maximum allocation for any specific asset
token or category.

[[rule-18-fund-cap]]
Rule 18: Fund Cap
+++++++++++++++++

This rule could be implemented by an Investment Manager to cap the
overall AuM of a Melon Fund for various reasons, in particular when a
specific strategy may have no further market capacity within its
mandate.

[[rule-19-fund-audit]]
Rule 19: Fund Audit
+++++++++++++++++++

This rule could be implemented by an Investment Manager to enforce fund
audits by a pre-determined auditor at defined time intervals. Funds
implementing this rule would be restricted from trading (except into the
denomination asset) when an audit has not been performed within the
defined time interval.

should not be subject to the maximum positions rule as the denomination
asset represents non-exposure to the wider market. In cases where the
taker asset is not the denomination asset, the function evaluates the
post-trade number of non-denomination asset positions in the fund,
returning `true` if the post-trade number of non-denomination asset
positions in the fund does not exceed the maximum positions

`function takeOasisDex(address ofExchange, bytes32 identifier, uint fillTakerQuantity) view returns (bool)`

This view function gathers data from the existing Oasis Dex order and
respective amounts filled, then compares the resulting price with the
tolerance percentage-adjusted reference price from the price feed. If
the order price does not exceed the tolerance percentage-adjusted
reference price, the function returns `true` and the fund is permitted
to take the order (partial- or complete fill); otherwise the function
returns `false`, the trade is not permitted and the transaction is
reverted.  

`function takeGenericOrder(address makerAsset, address takerAsset, uint[3] values) view returns (bool)`

This view function accommodates generic exchange take order
functionality, calculating the maker fill quantity given the taker
quantity, maker quantity and the taker fill quantity, then compares the
resulting price (fill quantity ratio) with the tolerance
percentage-adjusted reference price from the price feed. If the take
order price does not exceed the tolerance percentage-adjusted reference
price, the function returns `true` and the fund is permitted to take the
order (partial- or complete fill); otherwise the function returns
`false`, the trade is not permitted and the transaction is reverted.  

`function takeOrder(address[5] addresses, uint[3] values, bytes32 identifier) public view returns (bool)`

This view function is evaluated prior to executing take orders on
exchanges and determines the execution routing for take orders depending
on value of the `identifier` parameter. If the parameter
`identifier == 0x0` (denoting a 0x-integrated exchange), the function
calls `takeGenericOrder()` and `takeOasisDex()` otherwise, passing all
input parameters on to the subsequent function call.  

`function makeOrder(address[5] addresses, uint[3] values, bytes32 identifier) public view returns (bool)`

This view function is evaluated prior to executing make orders on
exchanges. The function determines the current reference price for the
asset token pair, then determines the price as determined by the make
offer quantities. If the make order price does not exceed the tolerance
percentage-adjusted reference price, the function returns `true` and the
fund is permitted to submit the make order to the exchange; otherwise
the function returns `false`, the make order is not permitted and the
transaction is reverted.  

`function rule(bytes4 sig, address[5] addresses, uint[3] values, bytes32 identifier) external view returns (bool)`

This view function is evaluated prior to executing make orders or take
orders on exchanges and determines the execution routing for these order
types depending on value of the `sig` parameter, which is the keccak256
hash of the plain text function signature of `makeOrder()` or
`takeOrder()`. The function returns `true` for permitted orders,
i.e. make orders can be submitted to the exchange and take orders can be
traded. The function returns `false` for prohibited orders which violate
the price tolerance criteria, reverting the transaction. For a full
description of the parameters, please refer to `rule()` in the general
Policy contract above.
